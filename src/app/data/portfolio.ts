Web Vulnerability Writeup: Cyber Academy's PT Vulnapp Challenge


This writeup summarizes my penetration testing report for PT Vulnapp, a vulnerable job portal web application used in the Cyber Academy Penetration Testing Challenge.
The assessment was conducted on 17 April 2026 - 18 April 2026 using a grey-box testing approach. The main objective was to identify, validate, and document security weaknesses that could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

Scope

The assessment focused on the main web application and several critical security areas, including:

- Authentication bypass
- Account takeover risk
- SQL Injection
- Sensitive data exposure
- File upload security
- Access control
- Session management
- Security header configuration
- Information disclosure

Methodology

The test followed a structured penetration testing workflow:

1. Reconnaissance and application mapping
2. Parameter analysis and request interception
3. Fuzzing and exploitation
4. Risk assessment using CVSS
5. Documentation and remediation planning


Vulnerability List

| No | Finding | Severity | Status |
| 1 | SQL Injection - Login Bypass | Critical | Open |
| 2 | SQL Injection - Error Based | Critical | Open |
| 3 | Time-Based Blind SQL Injection - Search Job | Critical | Open |
| 4 | Sensitive Data Exposure | Critical | Open |
| 5 | Unrestricted File Upload - Stored Arbitrary File | High | Open |
| 6 | Insecure Direct Object Reference - Job Enumeration | High | Open |
| 7 | Insecure Session Termination | Medium | Open |
| 8 | Weak Password Policy | Medium | Open |
| 9 | Missing Security Headers | Medium | Open |
| 10 | Information Disclosure - Nginx Version | Low | Open |


Through this challenge, I practiced:

- Web application penetration testing
- SQL Injection testing
- Access control analysis
- Session security review
- File upload security testing
- Security header review
- CVSS-based risk assessment
- Technical report writing

Final Note
This is a public summary of the assessment. The full technical report is available in PDF format through the attached writeup link.
